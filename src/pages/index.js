            to address the issue of gun violence through an interactive,

            focused on integrating AirTable data with our Jekyll site and built
            the search functionality using the Algolia API.

            Arnold Ventures sought to improve the way they communicate their grant data. I worked in all steps of the design process from research and data analysis to design and finally development to visualize this data. The visualization was built in D3.js and integrated into a Craft CMS backend.

            The Globe took a look at what happens to Bostonâ€™s top students years after graduation. I started working on the project by tracking down and contacting valedictorians. Over the course of three months, I spoke with 30 valedictorians and collected data for the projectâ€™s research.

            I went to my first concert in 2014 (it was Arcade Fire). Iâ€™m a big live music fan and frequent concerts often, so I decided to document them more formally before I start to forget. I had been keeping a list in a note doc but took the opportunity to apply the same tech stack I learned from Since Parkland. This version is built in Jekyll with data from AirTable and is a work in progress.

              So, like I said, Iâ€™m about to graduate from Northeastern where I study computer science and design. Originally, I just wanted to be a traditional designer-developer, but then I found data, and then I found journalism.
            </p>
            <p>
              I see so much potential to leverage data and the digital space to tell stories that need to be heard in ways that make sense. As I get ready to kickstart my career, Iâ€™m thinking about how my background&mdash;technical and personal&mdash;can influence the work that I do.

              When Iâ€™m not thinking about my career, Iâ€™m thinking about bagels from Long Island where I grew up.  Iâ€™m a big design and data nerd, and I go to a lot of concerts. Ask me about coffee or tea, or we can get some sometime!
