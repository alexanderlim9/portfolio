            Arnold Ventures sought to improve the way they communicate their grant data. I led and worked in all steps of the design process from research and data analysis to design and finally development to create the "Grants" page and visualize this data. The visualization was built in D3.js and integrated into a Craft CMS backend.

            I went to my first concert in 2014 (it was Arcade Fire). I‚Äôm a big live music fan and frequent concerts often, so I decided to document them more formally before I start to forget. I took this as opportunity to apply the same tech stack I learned from Since Parkland. This version is built in Jekyll with data from AirTable and is a work in progress: more details, photos, and videos to come.

            <p>
              I‚Äôm about to graduate from Northeastern where I study computer science and design. I started out as a traditional front-end developer and found a passion for data visualization. What I lacked, though, was purpose. And I found that purpose in journalism.
            </p>
            <p>
              I see so much potential to leverage data and the digital space to tell stories that need to be heard. Journalism is evolving, and I‚Äôm right there with it. As I move forward, I‚Äôm thinking about how my background&mdash;technical and personal&mdash;can influence the work that I do and the impact I can have as a developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I‚Äôm not thinking about work, I‚Äôm thinking about bagels from Long Island where I grew up.  I‚Äôm a big design and data nerd, and I <i>love</i> trains. I also care a lot about diversity and representation, and I‚Äôm a proud member of <a href="https://www.aaja.org/" target="_blank">AAJA</a>. Ask me what I know about coffee or tea, or we can get some sometime!
